  <p>Questionaut is a personal project - a place for me to ramble and put whatever I want. It's run by me, Modupe, a university student and general creative type. I do often take breaks from the web, but I'm hoping to stick with this thing long term!</p>

              <p>&#x272A; 1/08/23 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_rabbit_rabbit">white rabbit!</a></p>
           <p>&#x272A; 31/07/23 - mad ting. it's been a hot minute - i got a little manic, kind of forgot i had hobbies. yeah, look, you know, man. q-naut went offline for a while but it's back now + hopefully should be able to stay in a state where i'm happy for it to be up. it doesn't suck as much as i thought it did, you know? i'm testing <span style="font-family:temb; font-size:18px;">this ratatouille-ass font</span> for the links 'cos i think it's really funny.</p>
          <p>&#x272A; 3/3/23 - that's a cool number. i rejigged the uhhhh site layout because i'm actually feeling a proper, static sidebar for the desktop layout? i think the older version is better suited to tumblr tbh. i might use the extra space for something else. still yet to decide on the audio player situation. maybe i'll have one track per page?</p>
               <p>&#x272A; 14/2/23 - happy valentines day! removed a lot of the dead/wip links on my site! they'll be back up when i've completed more bits on it. now page *updated*, and a blog entry has been added :-)!</p>
            <p>&#x272A; 6/2/23 - jesus, it's been a while. uni has been kicking my ass. edited the zonelet for politeness, and added enough to the alex g page for it to be uploaded to the site in a semi-complete form. i'll probably in the mood to add more to it when i've seen him live. onto the next section of the interests page, and we should be onto weekly or fortnightly updates - no promises!</p>
                 <p>&#x272A; 30/12/22 - two more entries on the blog now, + a new week added to meds tracker if you're that way inclined. started work on alex g shrine. should be uploaded in its completed state in the new year, but the intro is up now.</p>
                 <p>&#x272A; 26/12/22 - another slow one. gotta write an entry for the blog. did an 'interests' button but something's slightly off... i'll fix it later. i'm still not sure what it is??</p>

    <p>&#x272A; 25/12/22 - interesting day. skeleton for /interests.html done, fleshed out /now.html a little more. i'm not sure if it should just be on the sidebar... will have to redo buttons. songs added to the playlist. pretty meh but servicable sitemap present - now to do the *fun*, sexy webpages, the interests. and my oc pages, which i will 100% do first. go peruse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">the best web site in the world</a> if you're tense with anticipation about that.</p>
    <p>&#x272A; 24/12/22 - did my guestbook!!!! added some images to /about , el o ell. now to actually *do* the sitemap. with lots of patience and many, many reuploads of my css, i've reskinned the scm player for my site.</p>
    <p>&#x272A; 23/12/22 - rejigged the directories, zonelet has now been relegated to /diary/ zone. finished (ish) /about.html. onto the sitemap and now page!!!</p>
     <p>&#x272A; 22/12/22 - wow what a cool number! completely rejigged desktop layout. need to fuck around w files lol</p>
